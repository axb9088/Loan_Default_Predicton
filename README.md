# 📊 Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict loan default risk based on borrower and loan-related features. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using classification techniques.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Cleaned and prepared real-world financial dataset  
- Performed EDA to uncover trends and correlations related to default risk  
- Engineered relevant features to improve model performance  
- Trained multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  

## 🎯 Goal
To identify high-risk loan applicants and support financial institutions in minimizing default-related losses.

## 📁 Files
- `Final_Loan_Default_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete workflow

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab

## ✅ Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance
- Deployment of the model using Flask or Streamlit
- Integration with real-time loan application systems
